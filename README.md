# imgs-from-url
A small python script to download .jpg and .png from any url thrown to it. Easy to use with comments at every step for better understanding of code! 

<b>How to use:</b>
1) Clone this repo or just download zip
2) Make sure you have python 2.7 installed
3) Open imgfromurl.py and make neccessary changes as per comments made in code
4) Run the script imgfromurl.py
5) All images will start getting downloaded in a folder named src

Thanks
